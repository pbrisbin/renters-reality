      This project is dead. I'm sorry.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you thought it was cool (or just want the domain), feel free to
      <a href="mailto:me@pbrisbin.com">reach out</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data is preserved and the source for what once was here can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/pbrisbin/renters-reality">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Maybe some day I'll bring it back.
